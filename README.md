## todo

### fix/modify
* "the field of view doesn't change, which means I only have the impression of being higher and not taller" - look into fov on /grow_player
* "collision box doesn't seem tall enough when giant (like 3 blocks instead of 6)" - was set smaller, will be fixed
* "jumping doesn't scale when growing (but does when shrinked)" - will look into it
* "when going in F7 mode, the camera distance doesn't scale" - known issue, have to do some research

### planned
* spawn a mob under a player, tie them to the mob, and vanish them.
* possible screw with inventory
